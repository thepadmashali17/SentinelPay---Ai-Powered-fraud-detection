# SentinelPay – AI-Powered Fraud Detection Platform

SentinelPay is an end-to-end FinTech fraud detection system that demonstrates how machine learning models are integrated into real-world applications using backend APIs, interactive dashboards, and compliance-aware system design.

The project focuses on **explainability, scalability, and production-style architecture** rather than model accuracy alone.

## 🚀 What does it do?

SentinelPay helps assess whether a financial transaction is fraudulent by analyzing behavioral and contextual signals.

**You provide:**
* **Transaction details:** Amount, timing, frequency, and merchant risk.

**The system returns:**
* **Fraud probability score:** A numerical likelihood of fraud.
* **Risk classification:** Categorized as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`.

The platform demonstrates how ML models are deployed, consumed, and explained in modern financial ecosystems.

## 🏗️ System Overview

The flow of data through the platform follows a modular, decoupled architecture:

1.  **User / Transaction:** Input via the interface.
2.  **Frontend Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit** for real-time interaction.
3.  **Backend API:** **FastAPI** handles requests and serves as the bridge to the model.
4.  **Fraud Detection Logic:** Processing engine using Scikit-Learn.
5.  **Risk Score & Decision:** Output returned to the user.
6.  **Blockchain Audit Layer:** Proposed immutable logging for compliance.
