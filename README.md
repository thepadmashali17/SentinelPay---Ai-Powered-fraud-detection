# SentinelPay – AI-Powered Fraud Detection Platform

SentinelPay is an AI-powered FinTech application designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. The platform focuses on explainable AI and secure audit logging to align with real-world banking and compliance requirements.

##  Project Status
Under active development.

##  Problem Statement
Digital payment systems face increasing fraud risks due to evolving attack patterns. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect sophisticated fraud and generate excessive false positives. SentinelPay aims to address this challenge using machine learning models that can adapt to complex transaction behaviors while providing transparent explanations.

##  High-Level Architecture
The system is designed as a modular full-stack application:

- **Frontend**: Transaction monitoring dashboard
- **Backend**: REST APIs for data ingestion and inference
- **ML Engine**: Fraud detection and risk scoring models
- **Blockchain Layer**: Immutable audit trail for verified transactions

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, SHAP
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ethereum / Polygon
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite

##  Planned Features
- Transaction risk scoring
- Fraud classification with imbalanced data handling
- Explainable AI predictions
- Blockchain-based transaction audit logs
- Interactive analytics dashboard

##  Future Enhancements
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Advanced time-series fraud models
- Cloud deployment
- Role-based access control
